LOGISTIC REGRESSION

Objective    : 	1)To clasiify the given data has a label '0' and label '1'
		2)verify results against scikit learn Logistic Regression Model

dataset	     :  Obatained from Andrew NG Coursera's Machine Learning course

softwares &  : 	Python(3.6.4)-jupyter notebook
		Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Scikit learn

Operating    : 	Ubuntu(16.04 LTS)
system

Description  :  Distingushing the data as label 0 and 1 depending on the features given.
		Predicting the label for given data through Logistic/sigmoid function
		cost function chossen wisely such that the function attains global minima.
		Gradient Descent algorithm is used to minimize the cost function which 
                gives optimal paremets for our model
