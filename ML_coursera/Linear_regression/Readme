LINEAR REGESSION


objective    :  1)To fit a linear curve to given dataset through linear regression with single as well as multiple features
		2)also verify results against sci-kit learn linear regression model

dataset	     :  Obatained from Andrew NG Coursera's Machine Learning course

softwares &  : 	Python(3.6.4)-jupyter notebook
		Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Scikit learn

Operating    : 	Ubuntu(16.04 LTS)
system

Descrption   : 	Predicting House Prices as the output of linear model using size of house and no of bedrooms as feature vector
		least squres error between the actual output to the predicted output used as cost function and Gradient Descent
		algorithm is used to minimze the cost function which result in optimum value of parameters of linear model.
