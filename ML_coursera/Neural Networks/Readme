Neural Networks

objective	:	To Train and Predict the label of mnist image data using only 			
			Feed Forward Neural Network 							 
Dataset	:		Obatained from Andrew NG Coursera's Machine Learning course
			excerise(3) 

softwares & 	: 	Python(3.6.4)-jupyter notebook
Packages		Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib 

Operating   	: 	Ubuntu(16.04 LTS)		
system 

Description	:	To Predict the label of a given mnist image data and Feed 				
			forward Neural Network with one input,one hidden and one 				
			Output layer.             
			Input layer nodes=5000
			Hidden layer nodes=25
			output layer nodes =10
			so size of wieghts between input and hidden layers is 				
			(401,26) and size of weights between hidden and ouput layers 			
			is (26,10)(including bias).
